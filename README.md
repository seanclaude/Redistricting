The precompiled binaries for the **lxml** module is available athttp://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#lxml. Depending on the whether you've installed the 32-bit or 64-bit of QGIS, the files to download are http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/ansi47vi/lxml-3.3.6.win-amd64-py2.7.exe (64-bit) or http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/ansi47vi/lxml-3.3.6.win32-py2.7.exe (32-bit).
