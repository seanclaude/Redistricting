## Dependencies
The plugin requires at least QGIS **2.2 or above** and is dependent on the following additional modules

- lxml
- python-win32  (windows only)



## Installation
Install QGIS using the OSGEO4W installer. Select the modules **qgis** and **qgis-full** under the Desktop category and install any suggested dependencies. Now, you just need to install the lxml module.

#### For linux and OSX platforms:
Use easy_install to install it. Make sure the development packages of **libxml2** and **libxslt** are installed first. Otherwise, your compiler with barf.

#### For windows:
The **python-win32** module can be installed via the OSGE4W installer. The precompiled binaries for the **lxml** module is available at [http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#lxml](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#lxml). Depending on the whether you've installed the 32-bit or 64-bit of QGIS, the file you need to download will be either [lxml-3.3.6.win-amd64-py2.7.exe (64-bit)](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/ansi47vi/lxml-3.3.6.win-amd64-py2.7.exe) or [lxml-3.3.6.win32-py2.7.exe (32-bit)](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/ansi47vi/lxml-3.3.6.win32-py2.7.exe). 

Do **NOT** click on the file to run it after downloading. Instead, open an OSGEO4W shell and issue the following command
> easy_install location-of-the-downloaded-lxml.exe-file

If **easy_install** is not found, download the file [get-pip.py](https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py) and install it, by executing the following command in the OSGEO4W Shell first
> python get-pip.py
